<h1>Nichholas Rocco</h1>
<section id="intro">
    <p>Hello! My name is Nicholas Rocco I am a web developer, visual artist and musician. I am currently residing in Augusta, Maine with my girlfriend Sarah and out three cats Ruthie, Maxine, and Wendy. I have a deep fascination with music synthesis. I enjoy learning about how synthesizers work, as well as soldering simple circuits for experimentation. My other hobbies include collage, hiking, swimming, collecting and listening to new music, as well as learning more about coding each day. I find that are many connections between computer music, synthesis, and coding. I hope to one day combine these hobbies to create new and interesting sound synthesis engines for exploration!    </p>

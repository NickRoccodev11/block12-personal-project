        <p id="intro-paragraph">Hello! My name is Nicholas Rocco I am a web developer, visual artist and musician. I
            am currently residing in Augusta, Maine with my girlfriend Sarah and out three cats Ruthie, Maxine, and
            Wendy. I have a deep fascination with music synthesis. I enjoy learning about how synthesizers work, as
            well as soldering simple circuits for experimentation. My other hobbies include collage, hiking,
            swimming, collecting and listening to new music, as well as learning more about coding each day. I find
            that are many connections between computer music, synthesis, and coding. I hope to one day combine these
            hobbies to create new and interesting sound synthesis engines for exploration!

        <q>I would rather be ashes than dust!
            I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.
            I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.
            The function of man is to live, not to exist.
            I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.
            I shall use my time.

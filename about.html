        <h3 class="hobby-section">Visual Art</h3>
        <p>From a young age, I have been fascinated with drawing and collage. As a kid I used to make comics and practice figurative drawing. I now tend to gravitate towards abstract work. I find both drawing and collaging to be extremely meditative. At times the work can be meticulous and require alot of concentration, but at other times it can involve a lot of repetiton. Working with visual art switches between soothing and challenging. Even if I don't like what I end up with, I always appreciate the process </p>

    <p>the pokedex is an app currently in development that will work in tandem with "PokeAPI" to provide users with pokemon stats, images, and sounds. Users will be able to choose pokemon for their roster and develop teams, swap out new pokemon, and store the data about their pokemon for later reference.</p>
